Hi, I'm **Diego Becker** — a Brazilian software engineer who thrives on real-world challenges and believes that chaos, when embraced with purpose, leads to growth.

With a background that spans software development, infrastructure, and operations, I’ve developed a deep understanding of how modern systems behave — especially when things go wrong. I enjoy the intensity of production environments, incident response, and building resilient platforms that actually make developers' lives easier.

I’m also a big fan of punk rock (shout-out to the Ramones), and that spirit of simplicity, authenticity, and rebellion shapes the way I work and teach. I'm not into overcomplicated solutions — I believe in solving real problems with clarity, speed, and a touch of controlled chaos.

This blog is my way of giving back. I create simple, honest, and practical content to help people start or transition into tech — especially in cloud, DevOps, and infrastructure. If you're just beginning your journey, I hope this space gives you tools, confidence, and the feeling that you're not alone.

Welcome to my corner of the internet — where tech meets attitude.
