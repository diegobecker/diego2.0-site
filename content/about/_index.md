# About Me

Hi, I'm **Diego Becker** — a Brazilian software engineer passionate about cloud computing, DevOps, and helping people start their careers in tech.

With years of experience in software development, infrastructure, and operations, I’ve worked across different areas that gave me a solid understanding of how modern platforms work. Today, I focus on building solutions that make life easier for developers and teams.

I created this blog to share simple and practical content for people who want to start or transition into the tech industry. My goal is to make cloud, DevOps, and infrastructure topics more approachable, especially for beginners.

If you're just starting your journey, I hope this space helps you learn faster and feel more confident.
